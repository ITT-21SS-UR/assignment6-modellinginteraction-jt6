    "\n",
    "P = target detection on the display with the mouse\n",

    "H = time for hand movement when changing input devices\n",

    "M = mental preparation time needed by the user to perform the task\n",

    "P = This was calculated by pressing the same keys 11 times or clicking the button 11 times in a row. This was repeated 5 times. To be able to compare the results, the same buttons with the same distances were used, in our case this was 1-1-1...\n",
    "\n",
    "H = To calculate the movement time, the number 1 was alternately entered on the keyboard and the button 1 on the calculator. The mouse pointer was always on the button and did not have to be moved. Thus the time can be measured which one needs to move the hand from the keyboard to the mouse and to click it\n",

    "\n",
    "We run the test for H several times because our results were always significantly slower. However it was always the same time and we therefore used it for further calculations\n"
